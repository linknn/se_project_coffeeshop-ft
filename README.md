# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the fulltime Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Adding nav links on each page to return to the top, or perhaps locking the nav from the header in place may improve navigation.

Some kind of transition between pages rather than one image stopping and another starting like perhaps a gradient between the background colors like how the about blends into the footer.

I think the form might also look better with it's own background rather than just sitting on the page.
